CHALLENGE 1: STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR
    DESCRIPTION: The program prompts user to input student marks and calculates the equivalent grade as per the following grading system;
        A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.
    
    PROJECT SETUP:
         1. Take user input using the prompt() method.
         2. Create a function that takes the input as argument and calculates the grade.
         3. Use If-statements inside the function to identify the correct bracket of the input marks and output the equivalent grade.
         4. Call the function.

CHALLENGE 2: SPEED DETECTOR
    DESCRIPTION: The program takes speed of the car as input and checks if its over 70km/h to award demerit points, and terminate license under extreme cases.

    PROJECT SETUP:
    1. Take speed of the car using the prompt() method.
    2. Declare a function that checks if the speed is over 70.
    3. Create another function that takes speed that's over 70 and awards a demerit point for every 5km/h above the limit. This can be called inside the first function.
    4. Call the functions passing in the user input as the arguments.

CHALLENGE 3: NET SALARY CALCULATOR
    DESCRIPTION: The program takes gross salary as user input and calculates Payee, NHIF, and NSSF deductions, eventually returning net salary.

    PROJECT SETUP:
    1. Take gross salary from the user using the prompt() method.
    2. Declare a function that takes the gross salary as sole argument and returns net salary after minusing deductions
    3. Declare a second function that takes in gross salary as sole argument and calculates payee tax.
    4. Declare a third function that takes in gross salary as sole argument and calculates NHIF deduction.
    5. Declare a second function that takes in gross salary as sole argument and calculates NSSF deduction.
    6. Call the last three function inside the first to aid in calculating the net salary
